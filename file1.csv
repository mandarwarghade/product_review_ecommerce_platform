0,mouse,Mohammad Ahmed,4,Really Nice,"Hey guys don't leave this mouse in this budget, absolutely good in working, smoothness is good on top of it. It could be  a FIVE STAR RATING if it packs well inside the box, i thought they must pack atleast a cover,😔😔 unfortunately i won't see any cover on it.. But it works well to my PC.That was the only thing i found in it....Must go for it 👍👍👍"
1,mouse,Swapnil  Kilanjar,5,Super!,Wayyyyy better than HP and DELL mouse I have used in the past. Due to its curves the hands fit perfectly. Compared to the old mouse it simply glides on the mouse pad and operation is smooth as silk. It's feather light weight and extremely pleasant to hold. The price is a big positive and I'm glad I made this decision. Just go for it.
